This is a king-of-the-hill challenge for [http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/).

The following programs are available:

- `lingo`: the game engine, which can be compiled with a Go 1.2 installation, using the `go build` command in the checked out repository.
- `driver.rb`: a ruby script used to evaluate player programs submitted on the website.
- `stats.rb`: a script showing a few statistics for the included word list.
- `player-example*.rb`: test player program implementations of various strength (although rather naive).

The file named `wordlist.txt` is an extensive list of english words to be used a reference by the game engine and implementations.
